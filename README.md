# README
Planning to add a lot more commands to this bot, but for now, it only has 3:
-> /hello
-> /help
-> /age

For the past day and up to now, I've been experimenting with different cargo crates and Poise seems to be a promising one, due to its compatibility with slash commands.
The bot is being hosted by shuttle, which essentially has a copy of this compiled code running on the cloud (no need to host locally)!
Shuttle has very good documentation and fast deployment speeds, which is why I've been enjoying it. I'll put the links to their .docs to read at your leisure.
